- optimize when min is at tail
    - no need to go down
- rotate stack a after half are transfered to stack b

- fix swap for new structure

=========== // ===================

Sorting optimization
    - controls
        - rotations
            - ra, rb, revr_a, revr_b, rr, rrr
        - 6 moves
    - When to do what
